# Stream Monitoring

#### This repo represents Python code for stream monitoring, where I take a screenshot of a frame and compare it with “no signal” screens to detect whether the stream is down or live. With a cron job and GitHub Actions, it automatically runs every 30 minutes.

### Built with love, Python, and vibe coding ❤️
